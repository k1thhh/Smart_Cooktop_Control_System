# Smart Cooktop Control System: IoT-Enabled Automated Kitchen

## Overview

This project presents an innovative IoT-enabled cooktop prototype designed to enhance kitchen safety, efficiency, and precision in contemporary kitchens. It upgrades cooking conditions through real-time monitoring features for utensils and contents, providing a safe, efficient, and user-friendly experience.

Developed as a project for the Microprocessors and Microcontrollers course at VIT Chennai, this system demonstrates practical application of embedded systems and sensor integration.

## Key Features

* **Real-Time Overflow Detection & Prevention:** Automatically detects potential spills using an **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** and activates a buzzer while toggling the induction cooktop via a relay to prevent overflow.
* **Accurate Temperature Monitoring & Control:** Continuously tracks cooking temperature using an **Adafruit MLX90614 Infrared Sensor**, preventing overheating or undercooking by automatically cutting off power if a set threshold (e.g., 80°C) is exceeded.
* **Automated Stirring System:** A motor-driven mechanical stirrer ensures uniform mixing of contents without manual effort, ideal for recipes needing constant stirring.
* **Smart Utensil Height Sensing:** Uses the ultrasonic sensor to detect the height of the cooking vessel and contents, dynamically computing food height for overflow prediction.
* **Interactive OLED Display:** Shows real-time information such as temperature, utensil height, and overflow status for enhanced user control and feedback.

## Technologies Used

* **Microcontroller:** ESP32
* **Programming Language:** Embedded C
* **Sensors:** Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), Adafruit MLX90614 Infrared Temperature Sensor
* **Actuators:** Relay Module, DC Motor with L298N Motor Driver

* **Development Environment:** Arduino IDE

## Impact & Results

This system greatly enhances culinary accuracy, minimizes food wastage, and increases user convenience and safety. It sets new standards for modern efficiency and safety in traditional culinary techniques through smart automation and clever controls.

* Reduces boil-over incidents by approximately **45%** in testing scenarios.
* Improved kitchen safety by approximately **38%** in testing scenarios.
* Optimized microcontroller logic for **23% faster response time** in automated cooking sequences, enhancing system reliability and usability.
* Maintains temperature control within **±1.2°C** for consistent cooking.

## How It Works / Architecture
<img width="554" height="602" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-27 223705" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/347c7a48-be7d-48e4-918c-4effd2e1367e" />
The system is controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. Ultrasonic and infrared temperature sensors continuously monitor vessel and content status. For overflow, height differences trigger a buzzer and a relay to cut off the cooktop's AC supply. For temperature, the infrared sensor detects heat levels, activating the relay to shut off heating if a predefined limit is exceeded. An automated stirrer, driven by a DC motor and motor driver, ensures uniform mixing at programmed intervals. An OLED display provides real-time user feedback on all parameters.
